## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Foundation (Steps 1-4)

#### Step 1: Project Initialization
**Objective**: Set up basic Astro project with TypeScript support

**Prompt 1:**
```
Create a new Astro project with the following requirements:
- Initialize with TypeScript template
- Set up basic project structure
- Configure astro.config.mjs for static site generation
- Add necessary dependencies: @astrojs/react, @astrojs/tailwind
- Create initial package.json with proper scripts for dev, build, and preview
- Set up basic tsconfig.json
- Create initial .gitignore file
- Add a simple index.astro page that displays "Portfolio Coming Soon"

Make sure all configurations are optimized for static site generation and GitHub Pages deployment.
```

#### Step 2: Tailwind CSS Setup
**Objective**: Configure Tailwind CSS with proper theming foundation

**Prompt 2:**
```
Building on the existing Astro project, set up Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui preparation:
- Configure tailwind.config.mjs with proper theme structure
- Set up CSS custom properties for color theming (light/dark mode ready)
- Create src/styles/globals.css with base styles and CSS variables
- Configure the project to support both light and dark themes
- Add basic typography and spacing utilities
- Test the setup by updating index.astro to use Tailwind classes
- Ensure hot reload works properly

The setup should be ready for shadcn/ui components to be added in the next step.
```

#### Step 3: shadcn/ui Integration
**Objective**: Install and configure shadcn/ui component system

**Prompt 3:**
```
Integrate shadcn/ui into the existing Astro + Tailwind project:
- Install and configure shadcn/ui CLI and dependencies
- Set up components.json configuration file
- Install initial shadcn components: Button, Card, Badge
- Create src/components/ui/ directory with installed components
- Set up proper TypeScript paths for component imports
- Create a simple test page to verify shadcn components work
- Ensure components are properly styled with Tailwind classes
- Test both light and dark theme compatibility

Make sure React integration works properly for interactive shadcn components.
```

#### Step 4: Theme System and Layout
**Objective**: Implement dark/light mode toggle and base layout structure

**Prompt 4:**
```
Create the theme system and base layout for the portfolio:

- Update index.astro to use the new Layout component
- Test theme switching functionality works correctly

The layout should be minimal but ready for content sections to be added.
```
